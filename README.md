# Credit Scoring Project

This project is a machine learning pipeline for **Credit Scoring**, built in Python.  
It predicts whether a customer is likely to default based on historical credit and financial data.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → raw and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter/Colab notebooks for exploration & modeling  
- `src/` → Python scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training  
- `models/` → saved models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- `requirements.txt` → list of dependencies  
- `README.md` → project documentation  

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection & importance ranking  
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1)  
- Option to deploy as a web app (Flask/Streamlit)  

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-scoring-project.git
cd credit-scoring-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
